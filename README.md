## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The major learnings in this project are layouting the content, flexbox and responsive web design.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me in learning flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
